### About
This is ecommerce site with portfolio and about sections. It was made for an artist to use it to show off their work and sell artwork and merchandise.

### Frontend
I chose to use Nextjs as a primary tool for the project, because is uses SSR and SSG, which is really good for that type of projects.  

### Backend
For the "backend" I'm using built in API routes, because it suffices my needs here. I'm using unusual ORM here, called Prisma, it's very progressive and I liked interacting with postgreSQL DB using it. The database is hosted free on heroku. 

### Misc
For state management I'm using Redux, and for styling I'm using styled-components library.

#### The project is in early development and code may change and will be refactored.
